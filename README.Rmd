# Concreteness

Concreteness has long been central to psychological theories of learning and thinking, and increasingly has practical applications to domains with prevalent natural language data, like advice and plan-making. However, the literature provides diffuse and competing definitions of concreteness in natural language. In this package, we codify simple guidelines for automated concreteness detection within and across domains, developed from a review of existing methods in the literature.

## Installation

You can install the doc2concrete package directly, like so:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("myeomans/doc2concrete")
```
